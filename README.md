# ðŸ–¼ TON Minter

This is an example of a default NFT minter provided by TON Foundation [minter example](https://github.com/ton-foundation/token-contract/blob/main/nft/web-example/index.html). It uses [TonCenter API](https://toncenter.com/) by default.

[TESTNET DEMO IS HERE ðŸš€](https://tonbuilders.github.io/tonbuilders-minter/)

**!!! STUDY-PURPOSE ONLY !!!**

Feel free to use it as a starting point to mint your first NFT collection and understand how the TON blockchain works with NFTs. Console has many useful information inside.

To mint **big collection** in mainnet better to use [TON diamonds NFT deployer](https://github.com/tondiamonds/ton-nft-deployer). It's perfect for collections with 10-10000 items.

### Important for local development

[//]: # (You can create your own TON Minter instance in 1 minute in Replit [here]&#40;https://repl.it/@ton-minter/ton-minter&#41;.)

- By default, minter uses `TON testnet`. Change the network in a `constants.config.js`.
- Minter uses `TonCenter` API that needs a key. Please, add your own API key. Use bots from `constants.config.js` to create API key quickly.
